  <p>The meditation technique was developed by the Ancient Egyptians, which all forms of meditation derive from. "The Ancient Egyptians believed that mediatation was a way to harmonize with nature and to gain guidance/wisdom from the heavens." <br> Meditation has been used in Eastern civilizations such as China, and India as a form for peaceful livelihood. Africans has to master Yoga meditation to outshine different professions such as medicine and mathematics. Zen meditation evolved from practice in Japan. Meditation has helped people reach the top of their thinking and strengthen their bodies at the same time. <br> Studies have shown that meditation has a lasting improvement on the quality of life. Practicing meditation allows the individual to look deep within their self to learn about how you respond/react to external stimuli and build a sense of calmness and better focus. <br> </p> </div>
   <h2> How does your brain react during meditation</h2><p2><ul>
   <li>Studies have found that overtime mindfulness meditation may lead to an increase in grau matter density in the hippocampus and other frontal regions of the brain and increases in anterior insula and cortial thickness. </li>
  <li> The brain produces electrial waves throughout the day; from Delta, Theta, Beta, Alpha, Gamma, Hyper-Gamma, Epsiol, and Lambda waves depending on what you're doing. During meditation the brain has an increase in Theta which are the brain wave frequencies associated with a relaxed state of mind and and overall mental well-being. </li>
   <li>The frontal lobe which plans and reasons switch off during meditation, helping you to detach and relax </li>
   <li> The thalamus, which relays motor and sensory signal to the cerebral cortex slows down its activity, enabling you to stap calm. </li>
   <li> The parietal lobe which gives you sense of time also slows down helping you to lower your stress and anxiety levels by staying focused on the present moment "stillness"</li>
   <li> The recticular keeps your brain alert and helps you to respond to situations. During meditation, the reticular activity alows down, allowing you to become more peaceful </li>
   </ul>
