   <article> <i>Hello, my name is Valerie. <br> I started practicing meditation about 4 years ago. Throughout this time I have acquired and complied some helpful information to relay to others with the intent to help assist you during your journey and/or practices. <br> During my path to spiritual enlightenment I realized that everything I was searching for has always been inside of me. As I sat in stillness and listened to my inner thoughts in a non-judgemental way, but a way to learn myself deeply. I realized that meditation was just the beginning of developing a strong sense of self and connecting to all things around me. <br><br> I hope this information finds you in good health and with an open-mind but, more importantly you use this information to help yourself or someone you know.  </i></article>
